<Section title="AR Zoo" video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDFs6mpai_k">
<Fade>

Augmented Reality application, developed on Unity and using the library Vuforia for AR.

The idea of this app is that children can collect items with an NFC chip, which will react with the app to show virtual animals on the screen of a smartphone or a tablet.
