<Section title="Overview">
<Fade>

During IronHack Bootcamp, I had to work on several projects.

</Fade>
<Fade>

For all of them I had to imagine the best experience, and create the adequate UI.

<Section title="Prisma Media / Télé Loisirs">
<Section title="Context" sub>
<Fade>

Project for Télé Loisirs, a French TV program magazine with its own application. They want to add a feature on their app including Augmented Reality (AR).

</Fade>
</Section>

<Section title="Challenge" sub>
<Fade>

Bring a new interest for users by making the application more interactive and innovative, by adding an AR feature on their app.

</Fade>
</Section>

<Section title="Solution" sub>
<Fade>

The idea was to create a live feed in AR, where users will be able to react to ongoing programs, and will be able to see 3D avatars and their reactions next to their television. After studying the target population, it was clear that when people watch TV, they have their phone around so they can react and comment to the program.

</Fade>
<Fade>

The goal was to bring this feedback concept within the app, so the viewer can have the best of both worlds. To enhance a seamless watching experience with the possibility to react, I developed a live feed in AR, and 3D avatars for every app user. All comments posted via the avatar are then shared on social media, to increase talking points.

<Section title="Lafayette Gourmet (Hypothetical Project)">
<Section title="Context" sub>
<Fade>

Lafayette Gourmet is a store where clients can eat in different restaurants, but also go grocery shopping.

</Fade>
</Section>

<Section title="Solution" sub>

<Fade>

The idea was to create an application allowing users to order from both services, where they can be delivered meals from restaurants, and groceries at the same time.

<Section title="Context" sub>
